Dear Sir,

### **INVITATION TO SERVE AS PATRON TO THE RENEWED HOPE INNOVATION COALITION (RHIC)**

On behalf of the leadership and the entire membership of the **Renewed Hope Innovation Coalition (RHIC)**, we present our compliments to you and your esteemed office.

We have followed with profound admiration your visionary leadership at the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). Your tireless efforts in driving Nigeria’s digital economy, fostering indigenous innovation, and implementing the Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan (SRAP 2.0) have not only positioned Nigeria as a tech hub in Africa but have directly actualized the digital transformation pillar of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s **Renewed Hope Agenda**.

**The Coalition and Its Mission**
The Renewed Hope Innovation Coalition (RHIC) is a professional ecosystem of tech-driven youth, innovators, and grassroots mobilizers dedicated to bridging the gap between governance and the tech sector. We are proud to state that RHIC is duly recognized by the **National All Progressives Congress (APC) Headerquarters as a Recognized Support Group**, with a mandate to mobilize, innovate, and advocate for the administration’s achievements.

**Why Your Patronage is Critical**
As a "World-Class" professional and a Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE), your personal and professional journey serves as a beacon of excellence for our members. Your patronage would provide:
1.  **Strategic Mentorship**: Guiding our coalition in aligning local innovations with national policy frameworks.
2.  **A Showcase for Excellence**: RHIC serves as a primary vehicle to showcase your administrative achievements and the broader successes of the Tinubu administration within the ICT and digital economy sectors to the grassroots and the international community.
3.  **Institutional Synergy**: Strengthening the link between the youth-led innovation ecosystem and NITDA’s regulatory and developmental objectives.

**Our Core Objectives**
- **Digital Inclusion**: Mobilizing grassroots support for national digital literacy programs.
- **Innovation Advocacy**: Providing a platform for young Nigerians to contribute to policy discussions on emerging technologies.
- **Administrative Transparency**: Deploying digital tools (like the RHIC Platform) to track and report the impact of government projects in the tech sector.

**Request for Audience**
We firmly believe that your guidance as a Patron will catalyze our efforts to drive national progress through technology. We therefore humbly request a brief audience with you at your earliest convenience to formally discuss the structure of the coalition and our strategic objectives for the 2026-2027 cycle.

We thank you for your unwavering commitment to a digital Nigeria and look forward to the possibility of working under your distinguished patronage.

Please accept, Sir, the assurances of our highest professional regards.

Yours Faithfully,
